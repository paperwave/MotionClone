# MotionClone
This repository is the official implementation of [MotionClone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04725). It is a training-free framework that enables motion cloning from a reference video to control text-to-video generation.

> We propose MotionClone, a training-free framework that enables motion cloning from a reference video to control text-to-video generation. We employ temporal attention in video inversion to represent the motions in the reference video and introduce primary temporal-attention guidance to mitigate the influence of noisy or very subtle motions within the attention weights. Furthermore, to assist the generation model in synthesizing reasonable spatial relationships and enhance its prompt-following capability, we propose a location-aware semantic guidance mechanism that leverages the coarse location of the foreground from the reference video and original classifier-free guidance features to guide the video generation.

## üöÄ Method Overview
<div align="center">

</div>

As illustrated in the framework above, MotionClone comprises two core components in its guidance stage: **Primary Temporal-Attention Guidance** and **Location-Aware Semantic Guidance**, which operate synergistically to provide comprehensive motion and semantic guidance for controllable video generation.

## üîß Preparations
### Setup repository and conda environment

```
git clone https://github.com/Bujiazi/MotionClone.git
cd MotionClone

conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate motionclone
```

### Download Stable Diffusion V1.5

```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 models/StableDiffusion/
```

### Prepare Community Models

Manually download the community `.safetensors` models from [RealisticVision V5.1](https://civitai.com/models/4201?modelVersionId=130072) and save them to `models/DreamBooth_LoRA`. 

### Prepare AnimateDiff Motion Modules

Manually download the AnimateDiff modules from [AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff), we recommend [`v3_adapter_sd_v15.ckpt`](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff/blob/main/v3_sd15_adapter.ckpt) and [`v3_sd15_mm.ckpt.ckpt`](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff/blob/main/v3_sd15_sparsectrl_scribble.ckpt). Save the modules to `models/Motion_Module`.

## üéà Quick Start
